# Introduction
* In this project, we aim to analyze and predict housing prices based on various attributes or features. By analyzing historical housing data, we can uncover patterns and relationships that influence housing prices. This analysis will provide valuable insights to guide investment decisions in the real estate market
# Dataset Used in this Assignment :

* The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

# Installation4
* To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn



# Models

* We will explore and compare different machine learning models for predicting housing prices. Some of the models we will experiment with include:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression

# Evaluation
* The performance of the models will be evaluated using cross-validation techniques. This helps ensure that our predictions are reliable and generalize well to unseen data. The evaluation results, including the chosen model and its performance metrics, will be displayed in the console and saved in a text file named evaluation_results.txt.
